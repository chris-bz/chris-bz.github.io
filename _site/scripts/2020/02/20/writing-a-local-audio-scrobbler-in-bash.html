    <p>Scrobbling services like <a href="https://last.fm">Last.fm</a> are great for logging what we listen to and provide nice bunch of statistics to display trends in our musical habits.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why last.fm became so popular was because it added social dimension. People see what I am listening, I know what they’re up to. We can start a conversation about an interesting track we’ve both discovered recently, or concert we both went to (as it turns out).</p>

<p>But what if someone doesn’t care about all that and just wants to track down history and store it? In that case, there is probably no reason to keep something as precious as lifetime of your musical adventures on a remote server, even if the company is trustworthy.</p>

<p>Anything can happen to a website. A disgruntled employee on his way out might erase large portion of its databases.</p>

<p>One day, you might want to download your entire listening history. In case of Last.fm, this isn’t always easy. The service itself provided downloading whole history, but for years that option is gone.</p>

<p>There are other websites which extract it for us. But if your history contains hundreds of thousands of items, there is a big chance downloading those large files will fail at some point, making it possible to retrieve only some of that data.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, the only option left is to write a script that will extract that data from the last.fm wedsite, page by page. So now we have to know web scraping.</p>

<p>Why not writing our own script and store musical history on disk? It can beWe won’t need any application that might spy on us, we won’t heed internet connection. Every time system is on, scrobbling is on. 100% reliable. Let’s explore other arguments for it.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-local-scrobbling">Advantages of local scrobbling</h2>

<ul>
  <li>the script is just few lines long, possible to write even for someone who has just started learning Bash</li>
  <li>once everything is set up, it always works, if problematic strings are properly escaped/removed, there is nothing that can break your script</li>
  <li>the data can be stored using any format you want, you can easily change it later too</li>
  <li>you can have local server and setup any database you want for it (SQLite being best for the job, but even this is overkill)</li>
  <li>you decide which tag fields should be stored</li>
  <li>deleting unwanted items is as simple and powerful as your editor allows, as opposed to a click-fest if you decide to do it through a website</li>
  <li>even decade-long logs still won’t take more than dozen megabytes, which by today storage standards is zero</li>
  <li>we can extract whatever statistical information from it, imagination is the limit (but we have to do the work)</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>This tutorial choses Bash inside Linux as the environment of choice. We will be issuing system commands, which is always more natural from Bash, ZSH, Fish and other “system” scripting languages than from other programming languages, which usually require importing system libraries first and might produce code that is harder to read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For local scrobbling to be an easy ride, you have to use a music player that supports editing its title. Popular standard is for the player to display currently played track’s tag information as the application title. We need to be able to change from which tags we get the information.</p>

    <p>If you intend to use graphical application and don’t care about library, <a href="https://deadbeef.sourceforge.io/">DeadBeef</a> comes highly recommended. For console interface, <a href="https://cmus.github.io/">CMUS</a> is a popular choice. This tutorial will work with DeadBeef.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will need to download <strong>wmctrl</strong>. Your system package manager most likely has it. It is a small, very fast and very useful tool, I recommend getting to know it as it makes many interesting scripts possible.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="configuring-deadbeef">Configuring DeadBeef</h2>
<p>Go to <strong>Edit* -&gt; **Preferences</strong> -&gt; <strong>GUI/MISC</strong> -&gt; <strong>Player</strong></p>

<p>In the <em>Titlebar text while playing</em> field, replace the current string with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>deadbeef: %artist%;%album%;%title%;%year%;%length%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>…or any tags you want, in any order. The beginning part is important, we will be identifying program title by a string ‘deadbeef: ‘, so it has to be there.</p>

<p>You might want to change it to something more unique to never match that title elsewhere (in case you one day visit a website whose title contains ‘deadbeef: ‘ etc.). If you decide to do so, remember to change it to something identical both in DeadBeef options and in line 4 of the script.</p>

<p>In the <em>Titlebar text while stopped</em> field, replace the current string with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>deadbeef - not playing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important that there is no ‘*deadbeef: ‘ string here, as different string is a signal that deadbeef is not playing. If we’d add colon here, the script would assume that deadbeef is playing and that ‘- not playing’ is another currently playing track that needs to be added to a scrobbling history file.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="csv-as-our-format-of-choice">CSV as our format of choice</h2>

<p>Semicolons between tags decrease readability, but we are gonna make our log a CSV file, with semicolons instead of commas. CSV file is like a table, with each line being a row and cell items are divided by a comma, semicolon or any other symbol you choose. Tab is another good option.</p>

<p>We no longer have COMMA separated values, so it’s not a CSV file anymore, strictly speaking. But the idea is the same, so we keep calling it that anyway.</p>

<p>Even though it doesn’t look pretty (compare it to YAML, for example), we keep using it for practical reasons. If we ever intend to analyze that data in any way (most popular artist this year, most listened to track ever), parsing a CSV file is kid’s play.</p>

<p>Yaml is the best option for readability, but files can be considerably larger because of it and it can be a nightmare to parse. CSV is simple and reliable.</p>

<p>Because the format is very popular, many frameworks, libraries and other tools have CSV importing/exporting built-in. We won’t have to do any additional work to prepare the data ahead of our tasks. With YAML, we might as well need an assistant parser ;)</p>

<p>Remember that the character you chose as field separator can’t be present inside your music tags, or it will mess up your data. It’s good when all music tracks get pre-cleaned before being played for the first time. Check article list on this blog, I will write such a script and post it here sooner, or later.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="breaking-apart-the-script">Breaking apart the script</h2>

<p>#!/bin/bash
last_title_path=’/mnt/files-ssd/doc/scripts/logs/scrobble-last.log’</p>

<p>We start by pointing to Bash interpreter, which usually is in the main bin folder. Then, we create a variable which points to a string representing the path to a file which stores the last scrobbled track.</p>

<p>We could store the last scrobbled track in memory and save disk writes. An average of one disk write every 3 or 4 minutes is not exactly the case of machine cruelty and it won’t have any impact on our hard disk lifespan. And now we don’t have to be afraid of losing data on reboot etc.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="k">while </span><span class="nb">true</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is a common programming “trick” for an infinite loop. The idea is to start the script on system startup and always work. For that we need a loop that under no condition ever breaks.</p>

<p>‘While’ checks for something being true (or truthy, depending on the language), so while true is always true. True is true, it’s not gonna change at iteration 131. It guarantees the loop will run until the an outside source (like <em>kill</em> command, or system reboot) terminates the script.</p>

<p>Entire sequence of code will be executed line after line, after which next loop iteration will start, ie. it will begin to execute entire sequence again.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	<span class="nv">curr_title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>wmctrl <span class="nt">-l</span> | <span class="nb">grep</span> <span class="nt">-Po</span> <span class="s2">"(?&lt;=deadbeef: ).+"</span><span class="k">)</span>
	<span class="nv">prev_title</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>head <span class="nt">-n1</span> <span class="nv">$last_title_path</span><span class="k">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The logic of the script is that every 5 seconds, we will check current track against previously played one and only if it’s different, we will put it in log.</p>

<p>Wmctrl has a useful ‘<em>-l</em>’ argument, which lists all currently open graphical windows currently displayed on all our monitors. It also states on which monitor each window currently resides and, what interests us here, program title.</p>

<p>We wrap the system command in ‘<em>$()</em>’ list all windows, and then pipe it through grep. For the latter, we specify two options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>‘<em>-P</em>’, which changes default regex engine to Perl’s (best Regex version out there), which supports lookbehind</li>
  <li>‘<em>-o</em>’, which returns only what regex matches, instead of the whole line in which regex match was found</li>
</ul>

<p>A variable representing previously played track is set by printing it through <em>*head</em> with the ‘-n1’ option. On default, head prints the first ten lines of a specified. We just want one line, the first one, which the ‘n’ option secures.</p>

<p>We could just print the whole file, as it contains one line only anyway. Being more specific may protect us against something dumb we do with that file in the future ;)</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[[</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$curr_title</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">]]</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$curr_title</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$prev_title</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>After defining all the necessary variables, we get to the heart of our script. First, we check if the music player is playing anything, or the second test would produce an error and break our script if it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Then, we check if the currently played track is different from the last played one.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">		<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$curr_title</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$last_title_path</span><span class="s2">"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The next step is to replace the last played one with the currently played one inside our scrobble-last.log file. We need to compare future playbacks against this track from now on.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">		<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">$(</span>date +<span class="s1">'%Y.%m.%d;%H:%M'</span><span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">;</span><span class="nv">$curr_title</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'/mnt/files-ssd/doc/scrobbles/2020.csv'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, we’re constructing the final string and appending it to our main scrobbling file. The desired format features date and time in front, either together ISO 8601 format, or split by another separator (in our case semicolon).</p>

<p>Our file entries are added chronologically, so it’s good to have time of addition in front. And since date and time are always same width, readability does not suffer.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">	sleep 5</code></pre></figure>

<p>Before closing the if statement content and the loop, we order the script to sleep for 5 seconds. You can do so every any other time interval. Linux’s sleep program is very flexible, not only allowing seconds as a unit. The smallest one and the program default is seconds, though.</p>

<p>We can even use floats, so you can order sleeping for .1 to get ten checks every second, giving a 50 times greater resolution than the default and producing near-instant additions to the log. It a trivial task for the processor, so you don’t have to worry about performance.</p>

<p>For me, 5 seconds is precise enough. It’s gonna check everything anyway, and few second delays are completely irrelevant for statistical operations I am doing on the scrobbled data.</p>

<p>One case where setting lower time is important is when the user wants to make statistics of unfinished tracks. Then, he’d have to calculate total track length minus the amount it was played (timedelta between beginning of playback of this file and beginning of playback of the next one).</p>

<p>If you want that, few seconds will seriously screw up the data.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="making-the-script-run-on-system-startup">Making the script run on system startup</h2>

<p>We want the script to always run whenever the system is up.</p>

<p>The alternative is to either remember to manually start it before playback (stupid), or have the script monitor music player for beginning of playback and turn itself on when the playback is on and turn off when the playback is off (pointless).</p>

<p>While technically the second solution is cleaner, it has no practical meaning, while introducing a mechanism that perhaps one day could get broken. God forbids we notice 2 weeks later ;)</p>

<p>In any modern operating system, every second many things are happening in the background. Addition of another tool performing such trivial task is irrelevant.</p>

<p>After we have our script in a file, we need to make it run on system startup. There are many options for that. Below are two popular ones.</p>

<h3 id="put-it-in-crontab">Put it in crontab</h3>

<p>Crontab file contains instructions on running applications. Every Linux user profile has its crontab file. We can put precise time when we want to run something, specify days of the week when we need it run, run it every x minutes and many more.</p>

<p>It is a very flexible tool and it needs to be, since Linux is mainly used for servers, and servers often have complex task schedules.</p>

<p>One special use in crontab is to replace all the normal specifications of when it needs to be run with <em>@reboot</em>, so the command is executed on system startup and only then. In the case of our scrobbler.sh file, the command looks like that:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">@reboot	/path/to/scrobbler.sh</code></pre></figure>

<p>That line needs to be added to the user crontab file, which can be edited by writing that command in console:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">crontab <span class="nt">-e</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>‘<em>e</em>’ is short for ‘<em>edit</em>’. It doesn’t matter which line you put it in.</p>

<h3 id="order-window-manager-to-run-it-on-startup">Order window manager to run it on startup</h3>

<p>Window managers often have configuration files which are loaded on system startup. In those files, we can order starting up of applications, so they are run on startup as well. This way, we ensure that every time we load window manager, the script gets loaded as well, which is what we want.</p>

<p>I am using <strong>i3</strong>, in which I need to edit ~/.config/i3/config file and add this line to it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>exec /path/to/scrobbler.sh</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>One thing you might find lacking in this script is the ability to detect same track being played more than once in a row.</p>

<p>The way the script is designed, if we listen to the same track for half a day, the script does not see track change, and so it cannot see that we got a bit carried away with it.</p>

<p>Since I wanted to write a basic scrobbler example, I did not implement this feature. I’m sure there are many ways to solve this problem.</p>

<p>One is to convert track length to seconds (so we get single integer for comparison) and then monitor if the playback of that track spans for more than its length. The refresh in which it does for the first time, we append the log with another instance of that track.</p>

<p>That solution is not perfect though. If we pause the track mid-way for 2 hours and then resume it, it will add second line to log even though we are listening to it once.</p>

<p>Another thing is that services like last.fm have many algorithms for filling out the missing data. If tags contain misspelt information, they check against their databases to try and find a guaranteed match to correct it. We don’t have to do this, it gets done automatically.</p>

<p>With our solution, everything that is inside tags is logged directly, and so it is our responsibility to make sure the data is correct. It’s more work, but it gives better results than an automated guessing game.</p>

<p>Yet another problem is logging playback from services like Spotify. Popular services of this kind support scrobbling to last.fm. It will get logged the same as if we’d be listening through the music player.</p>

<p>You can try to go around it, but it will most likely be a messy road. You can set up a script to monitor music streaming service applications and extract data from their titles instead, but maybe the customization options for title display are not built into those applications and we’ll miss some of the data that we want, like track length.</p>
