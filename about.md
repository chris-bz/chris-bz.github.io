### About blog

Linux is an insanely powerful operating system when it comes to customization. On top of that, even pretty advanced ideas can still be very simple to materialize.

Many distributions come packed with plenty of tools to manipulate images, videos, edit mp3 tags, manage windows, program behavior, desktop look, backup scripts etc.

Often, the problem is that to achieve something, the user needs to know many applications and know how to use them together. And each time we tackle an idea, we gamble. Because maybe it can be done, maybe it can't? We will find the answer after spending many hours bouncing from one blog post to another.

I am a relatively young Linux user (only 4 years as of writing this), but since day one I've been trying things to customize the experience.

Entire lifetime of Windowsing, I wanted to do things that the system did not allow, and after discovering that in Linux most of it can be done one way or another, I got very interested.

This blog is mostly about those interesting customization options, applications working in concert to improve the daily system use.

Since I'm also in love with Python and prefer it over Bash for more advanced system scripts, some of those solutions will require its knowledge, unless you just want to copy-paste entire code without modifications.

### About me

My name is Chris Blachewicz, I am a programmer from beautiful city of Cracow, Poland.

For majority of my professional career, I was a web developer, mostly creating websites from scratch and then monetizing them in one way or another.

Many years ago, I wanted to learn programming and approached C++, but didn't go far with that. It changed few years ago when I got familiar with Python basics.

It is an absolutely amazing language and has insane amount of high quality libraries of all sorts. And so I switched from web development, which I was always finding a bit boring, to programming in Python, which is everything but.

Apart from Python, I work with bash, linux servers, html, css, django, jekyll, pandas, sql databases and more. For most tasks, it's usually multiple tools at once.
